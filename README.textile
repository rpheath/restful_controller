h1. RestfulController

This is a very bare bones abstraction of the RESTful actions for a Rails resource controller. Nothing fancy. Supports pagination (for the index action, mainly) and custom Models (that don't match the typical pattern - think of a SignupsController using a User model).

<pre><code>class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  restful_controller :pagination => true, :model => Post
end

class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  restful_controller :model => Post
end
</code></pre>

*Notes:*

* by default the model will be the singularized version of the controller (ArticlesController => Article)
* automatically sets the expected instance variable for your views depending on the action being rendered. For articles example, the "show" action would setup an @@article@ variable, while the "index" action would setup an @@articles@ variable, as you'd expect)
* "supports pagination" means a #paginated(params[:page]) method will be called on your model (you may need to add that)

h3. Nothing New
  
I'm aware that there are several solutions to this problem, but I didn't want/need all of the features from that of resource_controller and friends. This plugin is very straight-forward and is primarily used for a few applications at work.
